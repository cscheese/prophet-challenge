# Background and Purpose 
The purpose of this Challenge is to practice forcasting with Prophet within Google Colab and to reinforce prior skills. Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

# This Challenge is divided into four steps:
Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.
Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.
Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.
Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.

# Process of completing this Challenge. 

Initially I used Jupyter Lab to work on this challenge. But then when I re read the Challange instructions it talked about using Google Colab, so I changed to this application. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the embedded AI tool has really started to be helpful in generating code. It was not perfect. But it was very good. I reviewed each line of code it suggested and indicated where I used and accepted the AI Tool coding with each section. I also included notes about it's usefulness. 

I reviewed the extent to which the AI tool was generating code with my instructor and TA and they approved my use of it. 

Overall, I was very pleased with the tools preformance. 

# Interpreting the output. 
Although AI was used to generate code, the interpretation of the output and repsonse to the questions was completely my own work. Excepting the analysis of the graph in Step 4: Step 2. I met after class with my instructor and TA to gain an understanding of this graph.
